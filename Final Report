1. **Overview** of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to create an algorithm to predict whether applicants for the non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup will be successful for funding. This is a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded. All in all, the primary purpose is to predict whether funding was executed effectively amongst applicants. 

2. **Results**: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

  * Data Preprocessing
    * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
    * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
    * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  * Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    * What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

3. **Summary**: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
